# Artificial Intelligence-Assisted Green Chemicals Development (Capstone Project)

## Overview
This project explores AI and ML applications in green chemical development using dynamic laser speckle imaging. The focus is on analyzing nematode suspensions to evaluate motility and bacterial responses.

## Features
- **Image Processing**: Utilized MATLAB, ImageJ macros, and Python for speckle image analysis.
- **Machine Learning**: Implemented ANN, CNN, and regression models to predict chemical responses.
- **Data Analysis**: Conducted EDA and feature engineering to extract meaningful insights.

## Tools & Technologies
Python, MATLAB, ImageJ, Jupyter Notebook, Deep Learning Frameworks.
